WWW::SVT::Play
==============
This module supports extraction of meta data from the URLs on SVT
Play (<http://svtplay.se>). It is meant to ease the use of SVT
Play from the command line, e.g. viewing videos with mplayer
instead of the flash player. But it could also be used just to
integrate metadata information, like title, duration and other
stuff in other applications.

A simple script is included, useful for getting the stream URLs
for a given video.

Installation
------------
The installation of this module follows the usual steps for
installing a Perl module (based on ExtUtils::MakeMaker).

    perl Makefile.PL
    make test
    make install # this command will probably have to be run as root

This module requires at least Perl 5.10. It also has some non-core
module dependencies. A complete list should be available in the
Makefile.PL file (in the PREREQ_PM key).

If you see failing tests, please report them to me, preferbly
by opening an issue on Github.

Availability and Bug Reporting
------------------------------
The latest released version of this module is available through
CPAN. The latest development version is available on Github [1].

It's encouraged to report bugs on github.com, but I respect
your right to not have to create an account there. For this
reason, I have no problems getting bug reports, feature requests
and patches by mail.
